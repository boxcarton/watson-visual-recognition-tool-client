## Getting started 

1. You need a Bluemix account. If you don't have one, [sign up][sign_up].

1. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool if you haven't already.

1. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change `<application-name>` to something unique. The name you use determines the URL of your application. For example, `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

  ```yaml
  applications:
  - name: <application-name>
    command: npm start
    path: .
    memory: 512M
  ```

1. Connect to Bluemix with the command line tool.

  ```bash
  cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  cf login
  ```

1. Install the dependencies you application need:

  ```none
  npm install
  ```

1. Start the application locally:

  ```none
  npm start
  ```

1. Point your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

1. **Optional:** Push the application to Bluemix:

  ```none
  cf push
  ```

After completing the steps above, you are ready to test your application. Start a browser and enter the URL of your application.

  ```none
  <your application name>.mybluemix.net
  ```
